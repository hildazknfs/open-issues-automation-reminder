# Open Issues Automation Reminder

## What’s This About?

This project helps you keep track of important open issues by automatically sending reminder emails. It makes sure nothing important is forgotten and everyone stays updated on what needs attention!

Built with Python and designed to run smoothly on Linux, it uses the GitHub API plus cron scheduling to make sure you stay on top of your repo’s open tasks — without the extra headache.

## Why Did I Build This?

Back when I was interning as part of a Security Assurance team, I created an automation reminder using Google Apps Script to track important security findings from User Access Reviews and Management processes across various apps. It helped the teams responsible stay in the loop about outstanding issues.

Fast forward to now, I wanted a more robust, flexible, and scalable version — so here it is, rewritten in Python to run on Linux! It’s perfect for anyone who wants to bring some automation magic to their DevOps workflow.

## Cool Features

- Automatically scans your GitHub repos for open issues.
- Sends reminders to keep things moving.
- Runs seamlessly on Linux with cron jobs.
- Easy to set up and customize.

## The Tech Behind It

- Python 3.x (because who doesn’t love Python?)
- GitHub API (for all that repo goodness)
- Cron (to keep it running on schedule)
- Requests library (to talk with GitHub)

## How to Use It

1. Clone this repo.
2. Set up your GitHub personal access token.
3. Schedule the script with cron.
4. Watch it keep your open issues in check.

## Why It Matters for DevOps

Automation and proactive tracking are at the heart of good DevOps. This tool helps you keep your projects tidy and on track by making sure open issues don’t get forgotten — freeing up your time to focus on what really matters.
